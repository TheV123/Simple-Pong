# Simple-Pong
This is a simple Pong Project made for Code-a-block. I have included some additional elements to the Pong Code, I hope that it will reflect well on my application. Additions: 1). Pause Button that still keeps the characters moving (like the old school Pong game). 2). Score Winner Screen. 3). Another program with an AI bot
